Project goal: The goal of this assignment was to create a quiz that new JavaScript students can take to test their knowledge of the fundamentals. When the test begins, a timer is started, and multiple choice questions are asked. If an answer is incorrect, time is deducted and the next question is asked. If an answer is correct, the users score is increased and saved. Either when time runs out or the test is over, the user has the choice to save their score and initials to a highscore page. On the highscore page are highscores from as far back as the user wishes, with a "clear" button that clears all highscores.
